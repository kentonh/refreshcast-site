		<p>You're leaving money on the table. Rendering your episode with the advert audio forever part of the file is great for the advertiser, but not so great for you. Your back catalog will forever belong to that advertiser.</p>
		<p>It's now simple to dynamically insert advertising or other audio into your podcast episodes. The entire process is handled automatically, with businesses paying to have their podcast advertising placement available on your show for a certain amount of time.</p>

					<h3>The Problem With Baked-In</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Podcast ads started simply: the audio of the ad would be mixed right along with the audio for the show. It can be recorded at the same time as the content, or it can be edited into the audio file at a later time. The final product is a single audio file posted for listener download.</p>
				<p>Baked-in ads that never change; locked in that episode eternally. A listener could download or stream the show the day the episode drops or after discovering your show in five years. That advert would still be right where you left it.</p>
				<p>A podcaster could edit and rerender each episode every time a new advertisement is ready. But, goodness, that's a lot of work.</p>
